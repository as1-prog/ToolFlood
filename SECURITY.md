# Security Policy

## Purpose of This Project

ToolFlood is a **research and educational** framework for studying tool retrieval in AI agents. It is used to evaluate how synthetic or adversarial tools can affect tool-using agents, with the goal of understanding and improving the robustness of such systems.

## Reporting Misuse or Security Concerns

If you become aware of **misuse** of this project (e.g., use to attack systems without authorization, build malware, or violate terms of service), or if you have **security concerns** about the research or code:

- **Please report it** so we can address it and help protect the community.
- You can open a **private security advisory** on this repository: go to the **Security** tab → **Advisories** → **Report a vulnerability**.
- Alternatively, you can open a **public issue** with the label `security` or `misuse` for general questions or concerns.

We will do our best to respond to legitimate reports and work with reporters to understand and mitigate any misuse or security issues.

## Asking Questions

If you have questions about:

- **Intended use** of this project
- **Ethical or legal considerations**
- **How to use it responsibly** in your research or evaluation

please open a **Discussion** or an **Issue** on this repository. We encourage transparent discussion about responsible use of adversarial and security research tools.

Thank you for helping keep this project aligned with legitimate research and community safety.
